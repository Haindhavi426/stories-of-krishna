      The Stories Of Shree <span class="name">Krishna</span>
    </h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Lord Vishnu is a Hindu god who appeared on Earth in nine avatars. Krishna
      is one of them. Till today, Krishna’s childhood escapades are fondly
      remembered. Here are short stories of Lord Krishna for kids.

    <h2 class="birth">Krishna’s Birth</h2>
    <p>
      Kamsa imprisoned Devaki and Vasudeva and ordered his soldiers to guard the
      cell. Every time Devaki gave birth to a child, Kamsa would visit the
      couple and take away their baby. Dashing it to the wall, he would kill it.
      When Devaki was pregnant for the seventh time, the foetus was miraculously
      transferred to Rohini’s womb in Vrindavan. Kamsa was told that it had been
      a stillbirth. Devaki and Vasudeva’s eighth child Krishna was born at the
      stroke of midnight. This special day is now celebrated as Janmashtami.

      <h2 class="home">Krishna’s Foster Home</h2>
      <p>
        As soon as Krishna was born, the guards manning Devaki and Vasudeva’s
        cell went into a deep slumber, and the locks fell open.Placing baby
        Krishna in a wicker basket, Vasudeva left for Gokul. When he reached the
        Yamuna river, he saw that it was flooded due to the pouring rain. But he
        had to save Krishna’s life. So, without fearing for his own life,
        Vasudeva started walking across the river. With his every step, the
        waters receded, and Lord Vishnu’s serpent Adishesha protected baby
        Krishna from the rain. When Krishna reached Nanda’s house, he saw that
        his wife Yashoda had given birth to a baby girl. Slowly, he picked the
        baby up and placed Krishna in her place. Then, he returned to the prison
        with the baby. Devaki and Vasudeva had hoped that Kamsa would spare the
        baby girl because the prophecy had mentioned Devaki’s eighth son. But
        Kamsa didn’t care. He snatched the baby from their hands and flung her
        against a wall. Miraculously, the baby transformed into Goddess Durga
        and informed Kamsa that Devaki’s eighth son was alive and would soon
        come for him.

    <h2 class="putana">Krishna and Putana</h2>
    <p>
      Kamsa was desperate to kill Krishna, so he called for the fearful demoness
      Putana. He told her to assume the form of a beautiful, young woman and
      kill all the babies that had been born in the previous ten days. As this
      gave her an opportunity to instil fear in people’s hearts, Putana readily
      assented. Putana entered Krishna’s village. When she heard everybody
      talking about Yashoda’s newborn, the demoness immediately knew that this
      was the child she had to eliminate. Distracting Yashoda, she made Krishna
      suckle on her poison-smeared nipples. The poison did nothing to him, but
      Putana died.
    </p>
    <h2 class="butter">Krishna’s Love for butter</h2>
    <p>
      Krishna loved eating butter. As he grew older, Krishna started stealing
      butter from his own house and neighbours’. Yashoda hung up the butter so
      that Krishna wouldn’t be able to reach it. Slowly, other gopis also
      followed suit.Krishna and his friends weren’t the ones to give up easily.
      They worked out a solution to this. The next time they raided a house for
      butter, Krishna made his friends form a human pyramid. He reached the top
      and broke the pot of butter. The friends relished it, much to the anger
      and disappointment of the gopis! The story of Krishna, a youngster who
      stole their butter and distributed it to his friends and even monkeys, was
      related to Yashoda by her pals. Gopi went after her calf after telling her
      mother about it, but while she was gone, Krishna and his pals came into
      her home and stole butter. and also shows the yashoda churning butter for
      his son krishna.
